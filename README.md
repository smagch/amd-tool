# AMD command line tool to show dependencies tree
Status: abandoned
I just wanted to create build-tool for AMD which has nice command help since [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/) has no help messages. But I just stopped using AMD. I'm interested in [component](https://github.com/component/component) right now.
